Customer Churn Analysis:
This project aims to analyze customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company.
By identifying patterns in customer data, we can predict which customers are likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them.

Tools Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Methodology
Data Cleaning:

Used Pandas and NumPy to clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Utilized data visualization techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the customer data.
Explored various factors such as age, salary, geography, etc., to understand their relationship with churn rate.

Machine Learning Model:
Implemented Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn to predict customer churn.
Evaluated the model's performance and fine-tuned it to improve accuracy.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to predict customer churn.
By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.
